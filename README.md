# calculate-characters
It's one of my projects for Daneshkar Course part 6 to learn how to work with reduce method in JS.

First, sentence variable recieves a string.
Then toLow variable turns all characters to lowercase characters.
Finally, charac variable removes all space between words and makes an array of every characters not equal to space.

A reduce method, counts every characters and then with the help of forEach method, we show number of each character.
